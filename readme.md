# Graph library
This is a small side-project of mine, because I always give up algorithmic challenges 
whenever it is required to implement a graph or a pathfinding algorithm using dijkstra 
(if I get the writing wrong I am sorry), so I decided to implement it in a way that 
would be easy and fast to use.

__I do not plan to support anything, 
so feel free to use it but someone probably already made something better__
